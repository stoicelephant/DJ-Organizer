# DJ-Organizer

## This is a GitHub Repository for the development of a DJ-Organization Tool for DIDA 425

## Project Idea 
* User Visits webpage (hosted on github pages)
* User Accesses their spotify account using O-Auth
* User selects playlist from their spotify library 
* Use Open Source Tool to convert spotify playlist to Raw Audio Files (found spotDL - CL software, may have issues if not a spotify premium user, also found https://lucida.to/ or other possibilities at https://fmhy.net/audio)
* Use Open Source Tool (potentially 'EchoNest') to extract audio features from audio files
* Using these audio features develop a collaborative filtering / recommendation system
* Use the collaborative filtering system to obtain similarity scores between songs and find the ordering which minimizes the total similarity differences between songs
* Output an ordered list of songs, and convert this list back into a spotify playlist and allow user to import it back into Spotify 

## Progress
* I have set up the spotify O-Auth to be able to access my own playlists and obtain a list of song ids from the playlist, we can possible use these song IDs to pass through music ripping sites
* Start of the frontend, have a basic html,java,css setup to start working forward 

## Next Up 
* The whole project hinges on being able to extract audio features from these out of data samples, so try and find a way to do this. 

## In Progress
* Working to more deeply understand the analysis structure
* Were able to see that the h5 files in the million subset has the following analysis parameters (can we replicate the same using another complementary analysis tool??? )
